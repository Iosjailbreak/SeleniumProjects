~what does it do?~
it opens your github, types your information and login
to your account. Thats it XD

~Why there is file called installer.sh?~
if you want to start the script by just typing github in python ,
you need to copy github to /bin but installer.sh does that for you! :D

~how to set up everything?~
simply edit the github script and search for username = '' and 
password= '' then add your github username in username and 
add you github password in password. 

~how to install it?~
open terminal in the working directory , type 'sudo bash installer.sh'
done! :> you can now type github in terminal and you will login 
automaticly

~can i run it without installation?~
yeah sure you can , simply open terminal in the working directory
and type 'python github'

~why i cant login?~
did you check if your information(username/password) is correct?
dont forget that you need to edit github to add your username/
password
